          * An index is simply a string that represents a fixed range of time.

          * -> Multiplier index - the number of some unit of time (hours, days etc) since the UNIX epoch.
          * -> Calendar index - The second represents a calendar range, such as Oct 2014.
          *
          * For the first type, a multiplier index, an example might be:
          *
          *     1d-12355      //  30th Oct 2003 (GMT), the 12355th day since the UNIX epoch
          * You can also use seconds (e.g. 30s), minutes (e.g. 5m), hours (e.g. 1h) or days (e.g. 7d).
          *
          * Here are several examples of a calendar index:
          *
          *     2003-10-30    // 30th Oct 2003
          *     2014-09       // Sept 2014
          *     2015          // All of the year 2015
          *
          * An Index is a nice representation of certain types of time intervals because it can be cached with its string representation as a key.
          * A specific chunk of time, and associated data can be looked up based on that string. It also allows us to represent things like months, which have variable length.
          *
          * An Index is also useful when collecting into specific time ranges, for example generating all the 5 min ("5m") maximum rollups within a specific day ("1d"). See the processing section within these
          * docs.

          *      Event - a generic event which associates a timestamp with some data
          *      TimeRangeEvent - associates a TimeRange with some data
          *      IndexedEvent - associates a time range specified as an Index
          *
          * Construction
          * The creation of an Event is done by combining two parts: the timestamp (or time range, or Index...) and the data, along with an optional key which is described below. For a basic Event, you
          * specify the timestamp as either a Javascript Date object, a Moment, or the number of milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. For a TimeRangeEvent, you specify a TimeRange, along with the data. For a
          * IndexedEvent, you specify an Index, along with the data, and if the event should be considered to be in UTC time or not.
          *
          * To specify the data you can supply: a Javascript object of key/values. The object may contained nested data. an Immutable.Map a simple type such as an integer. This is a shorthand for supplying
          * {"value": v}. Example:*
          *
          *
          * Given some source of data that looks like this:
          *
          * const sampleEvent = {
          *     "start_time": "2015-04-22T03:30:00Z",
          *     "end_time": "2015-04-22T13:00:00Z",
          *     "description": "At 13:33 pacific circuit 06519 went down.",

          *     "type": "U"
          * }
          *
          * We first extract the begin and end times to build a TimeRange:
          *  let b = new Date(sampleEvent.start_time);
          *  let e = new Date(sampleEvent.end_time);
          *  let timerange = new TimeRange(b, e);
          * Then we combine the TimeRange and the event itself to create the Event.
          *  let outageEvent = new TimeRangeEvent(timerange, sampleEvent);
          *
          * Once we have an event we can get access the time range with:
          *  outageEvent.begin().getTime()   // 1429673400000
          *  outageEvent.end().getTime())    // 1429707600000
          *  outageEvent.humanizeDuration()) // "10 hours"
          * And we can access the data like so:
          *  outageEvent.get("title")  // "STAR-CR5 - Outage"
          *
          * Or use:

     /**
          * A TimeSeries represents a series of events, with each event being a combination of:
          *
          * time (or TimeRange, or Index)
          * data - corresponding set of key/values.
          *
          * Construction
          * Currently you can initialize a TimeSeries with either a list of events, or with a data format that looks like this:
          * const data = {
          *     name: "trafficc",
          *     columns: ["time", "value"],
          *     points: [
          *         [1400425947000, 52],
          *         [1400425948000, 18],
          *         [1400425949000, 26],
          *         [1400425950000, 93],
          *         ...
          *     ]
          * };
          *
          * To create a new TimeSeries object from the above format, simply use the constructor:
          *
          * var series = new TimeSeries(data);
          * The format of the data is as follows:
          * name - optional, but a good practice
          * columns - are necessary and give labels to the data in the points.
          * points - are an array of tuples. Each row is at a different time (or timerange), and each value corresponds to the column labels.
          *
          * As just hinted at, the first column may actually be:
          * "time"
          * "timeRange" represented by a TimeRange
          * "index" - a time range represented by an Index. By using an index it is possible, for example, to refer to a specific month:
          * var availabilityData = {
          *     name: "Last 3 months availability",
          *     columns: ["index", "uptime"],
          *     points: [
          *         ["2015-06", "100%"], // <-- 2015-06 specified here represents June 2015
          *         ["2015-05", "92%"],
          *         ["2015-04", "87%"],
          *     ]
          * };
          *
          * Alternatively, you can construct a TimeSeries with a list of events. These may be Events, TimeRangeEvents or IndexedEvents. Here's an example of that:
          *
          * const events = [];
          * events.push(new Event(new Date(2015, 7, 1), {value: 27}));
          * events.push(new Event(new Date(2015, 8, 1), {value: 29}));
          * const series = new TimeSeries({
          *     name: "avg temps",
          *     events: events
          * });
          *
          * Nested data
          * The values do not have to be simple types like the above examples. Here's an example where each value is itself an object with "in" and "out" keys:
          *
          * const series = new TimeSeries({
          *     name: "Map Traffic",
          *     columns: ["time", "NASA_north", "NASA_south"],
          *     points: [
          *         [1400425951000, {in: 100, out: 200}, {in: 145, out: 135}],
          *         [1400425952000, {in: 200, out: 400}, {in: 146, out: 142}],
          *         [1400425953000, {in: 300, out: 600}, {in: 147, out: 158}],
          *         [1400425954000, {in: 400, out: 800}, {in: 155, out: 175}],
          *     ]
          * });
          *
          * Complex data is stored in an Immutable structure. To get a value out of nested data like this you will get the Event you want (by row), as usual, and then use get() to fetch the value by column
          * name. The result of this call will be a JSON copy of the Immutable data so you can query deeper in the usual way:
          * series.at(0).get("NASA_north")["in"]  // 200`
          *
          * It is then possible to use a value mapper function when calculating different properties. For example, to get the average "in" value of the NASA_north column:
          * series.avg("NASA_north", d => d.in);  // 250
